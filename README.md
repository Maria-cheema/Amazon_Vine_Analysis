##### 1. How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
 -  Total number of paid reviews:  47
 -  Total number of unpaid reviews:  9584
##### 2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- Number of 5-star paid reviews:  15
- Number of 5-star unpaid reviews:  4516
##### 3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
- Percentage of 5-star paid reviews:  31.914893617021278
- Percentage of 5-star unpaid reviews:  47.12020033388982
## Summary: 
- I believe there seems to be positivity bias for the Vine review, because the percentage of 5-star reviews for Vine reviews is less compared to non-Vine reviews. Additional analysis that could be done with the dataset is to compare the overall Vina and non-Vine reviews of the 5-start rating to see if there is any difference.
